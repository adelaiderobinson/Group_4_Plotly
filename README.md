## Plotly
### EDS-217

For this project we explored Plotly. Plotly is a python library that allows you to make interactive data vizualizations. The base for this library is the javascript plotly library. 
We used Plotly to explore data vizualizations using Jupyter Notebooks, however plotly can also be used to create html files, or as part of Dash (another tool created by plotly) for web applications. 
There are approximately 40 chart types that can be made with this package.
